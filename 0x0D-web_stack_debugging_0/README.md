Webstack Debugging Series - Project 0x0D
In this project, we dive into debugging a web stack as part of the Webstack Debugging series. The series is designed to help Full-Stack Software Engineers develop essential debugging skills by fixing broken or bugged web stacks. Debugging is a critical skill that requires practice and attention to detail, and this project focuses on identifying issues in a web stack and resolving them manually.

The main objective of this project is to identify and correct issues within a provided Docker container running Apache, ultimately ensuring the server responds correctly to HTTP requests. Once the issue is fixed manually, a Bash script is created that automates the process, restoring the web stack to a functional state.
